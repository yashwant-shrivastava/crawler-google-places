*Fixes*

- Reviews scraping is now faster
- Handle error that irregularly happened when scraping huge amount of reviews

*Features*
- Added `reviewsDistribution`
- Added `publishedAtDate` (exact date), `responseFromOwnerDate` and `responseFromOwnerText `for each review 

## 2021-03-10
Fixes:
- `totalScore` and `reviewsCount` are now correctly extracted for all languages
- `startUrls` now correctly work non-.com domains and on detail places

## 2021-02-02
Fixes:
- Search keyword that links only to a single place (like `"London Eye"`) now works correctly

## 2021-01-27
Features:
- Address is parsed into `neighborhood`, `street`, `city`, `postalCode`, `state` and `countryCode` fields
- Added `reviewsTranslation` option to adjust how Google translates reviews from non-English languages
- Parsing ads. This means a bit more results. Those that are ads have `"isAdvertisement": true` field.
- Added `useCachedPlaces` option to load places from your KV Store. Useful if you need to scrape the same places regularly.
- Added `polygon` option to provide your own geolocation polygon.

Fixes:
- This one is big. We removed the infamous `Place is outside of required location (polygon)` error. The location of a place is now checked during paginating and these places are skipped. This means a **massive speed up of the scraper**.

- Automatic screenshots of errors to see what went wrong
- Added `searchPageUrl` to output
